https://apps.twitter.com/ 

To visit site go to <a href='http://yewgen.pythonanywhere.com/'>TWIT2: know where they live</a>

You need to enter a Twitter account and application will create a map with 15 friends marked on it

It is no need for more, as it's hard to analyse all data and moreover to collect it from Twitter

To make analyses more better, I created json_navigation.py file. With it's help you can get access to any kind of data in your .json file

I hope you'll enjoy))
